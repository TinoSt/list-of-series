# list-of-series
Imagine a list of x items. Each element of the list is a number between a minimum value and a maximum value. 
Each number may appear only once in the list. For example, if x has the value 7, the minimum value is 1, 
and the maximum value is 7, then the list might look like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. 

Challenge: Create a program that generates all possible combinations. Use as few loops or conditions as possible.
